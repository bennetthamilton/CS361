This exercise lets us practice some tiny but important principles from Martin's Clean 
Code. It has a programming part, and a short answer question.

Now, modify the code to reflect the principles from Clean Code, all pages through chapter 
2. (For this exercise, do not add new lines of code. For example, do not use 
attr_accessor or attr_reader).
